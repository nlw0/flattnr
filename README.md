flattnr
=======

A program that flattens images from open book pictures by fitting an accurate geometrical model to the text line directions.

Intended as a continuation of https://github.com/nlw0/book-picture-dewarping, but using just estimated text line directions to figure out the surface shape.

Project stopped indefinitely, but I always mean to come back to it some day...
